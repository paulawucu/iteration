# Z Score
```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(25, mean = 5, sd = 4)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec))/sd(x_vec)

z_score = function(x){
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x)
  return(z)
}

z_score(x = x_vec)

y_vec = rnorm(40, mean = 12, sd = .3)
z_score(x = y_vec)
```

How great is this?
```{r, eval = FALSE}
z_score(3)
z_scores("my name is jeff")
z_score(mtcars)
```
Let's try again
```{r}
z_score = function(x){
  if(is.numeric(x)){
    stop("x needs to be numeric")
  }
  if(length(x)<3){
    stop("x should be at least of length 3")
  }
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x)
  return(z)
}
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
z_score(3)
z_scores("my name is jeff")
z_score(mtcars)
```
